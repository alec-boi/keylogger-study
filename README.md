# keylogger-study

  A little Rust keylogger I'm working on using an input crate, it currently detects key presses and mouse buttons with some failures due to the crate 
I'm using, it also detects the date and time which the key was pressed with second precision using chrono.

  This is for educational purposes only and I do not take any responsability for any misuse of this software.
  
  If you want to help out with the project please comment and explain your code very well as I am a beginner and have some difficulty in understanding
other people's code
